Date: 13th February, 2023

Structural description method is to be used.
Design an 8-bit multiplier circuit that uses carry save addition (CSA) based 3-to-2 reducers followed by 16-bit adder using 4-bit CLAs with higher-level propagate and generate terms.
(a) Unsigned integer multiplier
(b) Signed integer multiplier
Design the logic for overflow detection.
Test cases for unsigned integer multiplier:
2 pairs of operands that do not result in overflow. 1 pair of operands that results in overflow.
Test cases for signed integer multiplier:
Following pairs of operands that do not result in overflow:
1 pair of positive operands
1 pair of positive multiplicand operand and negative multiplier operand 1 pair of negative multiplicand operand and positive multiplier operand 1 pair of negative operands
Following pairs of operands that result in overflow:
1 pair of operands of the same sign 1 pair of operands of opposite signs
